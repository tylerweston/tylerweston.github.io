# [spectro](https://tylerweston.github.io/spectro/)
Light and shadow game.  

- The point of a level is to shine the correct color of light on each of the detectors (The empty circles, they will fill when they are correct)
- Click on a light source to activate/deactivate it
- Click and drag a light source around to move it
- Click to draw/erase walls from the game board
- You get more points the less walls you use, so try to be minimal when solving the puzzles
- Keyboard shortcuts: R, G, B keys activate/deactivate the corresponding light, space goes to the next level when all the detectors are activate, ctrl-z to undo your last move, or ctrl-y to redo your last move.
