# [spectro](https://tylerweston.github.io/spectro/)
Light and shadow game.  

- The point of a level is to shine the correct color of light on each of the detectors (The empty circles, they will fill when they are correct)
- Click on a light source to activate/deactivate it
- Click and drag a light source around to move it
- Click to draw/erase walls from the game board
- You get more points the less walls you use, so try to be minimal when solving the puzzles
- Keyboard shortcuts: R, G, B keys activate/deactivate the corresponding light, space goes to the next level when all the detectors are activate, ctrl-z to undo your last move, or ctrl-y to redo your last move.  
  
The code for the game is available [here](https://github.com/tylerweston/spectro) 

# [hemhaw](https://tylerweston.github.io/hemhaw/)
A Boggle/Scrabble/Sliding Puzzle mashup  

- Move letters around and make words from tiles that touch each other.  
- The tiles are scored based on Scrabble points and the Scrabble dictionary, with one bonus point given per letter used.  
- Blank spaces are wildcards, use them as any letter. They aren't worth points, but they count towards word length.  
- You gain time for each point you score, with higher difficulties giving you less time per points.
- You can change the game palette by clicking the question mark in the top left to randomly select a new palette. This will be saved between plays.
- Click and drag the mouse to select words. Release mouse button to select your word. If you want to deselect a word, drag you mouse off the grid.  
- There is a leveling system that saves between games. Getting points will level you up, and as you gain levels it will take more points to move up to the next level.
- You can view your stats by clicking and holding down on your username at the top of the game at any time. Note that anything played in practice mode DOES NOT COUNT towards any of these totals. Only score, time, and words played in easy, medium, hard, or blitz mode count towawrds these.
