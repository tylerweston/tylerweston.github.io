# [spectro](https://tylerweston.github.io/spectro/)
Light and shadow game.  

- The point of a level is to shine the correct color of light on each of the detectors (The empty circles, they will fill when they are correct)
- Click on a light source to activate/deactivate it
- Click and drag a light source around to move it
- Click to draw/erase walls from the game board
- You get more points the less walls you use, so try to be minimal when solving the puzzles
- Keyboard shortcuts: R, G, B keys activate/deactivate the corresponding light, space goes to the next level when all the detectors are activate, ctrl-z to undo your last move, or ctrl-y to redo your last move.  
  
The code for the game is available [here](https://github.com/tylerweston/spectro) 

# [hemhaw](https://tylerweston.github.io/hemhaw/)
A Boggle/Scrabble/Sliding Puzzle mashup  

- Move letters around and make words from tiles that touch each other.  
- The tiles are scored based on Scrabble points and the Scrabble dictionary, with one bonus point given per letter used.  
- Stars are wildcards, use them as any letter. They aren't worth points, but they count towards word length.  
- You gain half a second for each point you get. How long can you play for?  
- There will be a new palette each time you play, if you don't like the current one click the top left of the window.
- Click and drag the mouse to select words. Release mouse button to select your word. If you want to deselect a word, drag you mouse off the grid.
