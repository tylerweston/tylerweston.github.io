This is a work in progress game to learn javascript. It is written using the p5.js library.  
Eventually I will have a more fully formed tutorial in-game, but for now:
- The point of a level is to shine the correct color of light on each of the detectors (The empty circles, they will fill when they are correct)
- Click on a light source to activate/deactivate it
- Click and drag a light source around to move it
- Click to draw/erase walls from the game board
- You get more points the less walls you use, so try to be minimal when solving the puzzles
- Keyboard shortcuts: R, G, B keys activate/deactivate the corresponding light, space goes to the next level when all the detectors are activate, ctrl-z to undo your last move, or ctrl-y to redo your last move. 


So far this is just an empty test page to figure out what the capabilities of these github pages are and how they work. Eventually, I will put some more interesting stuff here.  
In the meantime, here is some punctuation marks you can copy and paste in case any of your punctuation keys on your keyboard is broke: 
!@#$%^&*()-_=+{[}]:;"'<,>.?/|\  
I hope I got all the important symbols there, let me know if I missed any!
