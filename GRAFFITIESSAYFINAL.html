For much of history, it has simply been a way for people to record their thoughts without fear of retribution or suffering social stigma. Because of this, graffiti is often the only voice of the common people that survives from a period, as opposed to the myriad works of the academics, religious, and civic leaders of those days. How the two halves of this story contrast and interact can give us an intriguing, dynamic look at what was viewed as meaningful during these different time periods, but that are often not that dissimilar to each other. Recently, however, a new form of graffiti has emerged, a modern form of graffiti now highly visible in cities all over the world. Despite being illegal, dangerous, and not monetarily rewarding, the graffiti subculture continues to grow. Writers join this new subculture because it facilitates meaning making in their lives, by offering a clear set of rules to follow, a social hierarchy to climb, and a well-defined career path, all things that writers perceive as lacking in North American society.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c9 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since the earliest days of homo sapien, when the world was a strange, dangerous place, we have had a desire to leave our mark. Whether to memorialize our own fleeting existence or attempt to communicate with the eternal world, the need to scratch, draw, or otherwise mark meaningful symbols on the earth seems to be universal across humanity. This need to make markings has coemerged and developed along with other important psychotechnologies; graffiti was usually image-based as art emerges, pictographs as early symbolic languages emerge, and later literary in nature as alphabetic literature is developed (Russell, 2008). Just as these other important psychotechnologies were used to develop, explain, and memorialize what the thinkers of those times held as meaningful, graffiti recorded it. Graffiti &ldquo;is a form of communication that is both personal and free&hellip; [that] offers some intriguing insights into the people who author them and into the society in which these people belong&rdquo; (Peden, 2001). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s important distinctions between the use of classical literature to explore meaning, and exploring meaning through graffiti: While literacy was often the privilege of the elite and learned classes in society, graffiti had far lower barriers to entry. That is not to say the elite did not also produce graffiti, as graffiti was produced by citizens from all levels of society (Zadorojnyi, 2011; Keegan, 2014; Champion 2015). Graffiti also &ldquo;allow[s] the key benefit of anonymity, which protects the writer from retribution&rdquo; (Rodriguez, 2015), and thus, they may be more free to express their innermost thoughts. Through the study of graffiti and literature, we could expect to see two lines of exploration in regards to the question of meaning, that of the societal elite, and that of the common man. Yet, for most of history, what has been recorded through the literary canon, and what we find scratched into the walls of monuments, churches, and private dwellings seem to reflect common sets of values, or places that humans have found meaning: Religion, politics, sex, philosophy, and the very act of being a human (Lomas 1973; Keegan, 2014). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Since the early years of the 1970&rsquo;s, a new form of graffiti has emerged. Large colorful nicknames, known as the writers tag, often illegally painted under cover of night, have sprung up, gaining initial prominence in New York city and quickly spreading around the world (Powers, 1996). What is this new form of graffiti that has split so radically from the graffiti traditions of the past, and quickly taken over the lives of the many diverse participants in this new subculture all over the world? Why do so many people risk their lives and liberty to paint pseudonyms all over their environment? This paper argues that the emergence of graffiti as a practice is a way for disenfranchised youth to respond to the meaning crisis by creating an alternate world, with clearly defined values and rules, which allows them to create a rich, meaningful and valuable life within the confines of this particular subculture.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ancient Egypt was among the first civilizations to develop written language, beginning with proto-literate symbols in the bronze age, which later developed into hieroglyphics during the pre-axial glory days of the Egyptian civilization (Gardiner, 1915). Despite the fact they had developed language, the vast majority of Egyptians were illiterate, with only scribes, and the most important religious and civil leaders being literate. They accounted for only about 1-5 percent of the population (Harris, 1991; Keegan, 2014). Because of this, much of the graffiti the Egyptians left behind reflect the values held by the upper echelons of society, and thus what we think of as &ldquo;the&rdquo; value system for ancient Egyptians, the Continuous Cosmos view, is reflected in the graffiti left behind by these ancient people. Egyptians did not share the same concept of history as we do, in fact &ldquo;Egyptians&hellip; did not write history at all&rdquo; even though they &ldquo;were intensely interested in the origin of the universe, in their gods, in life after death, and in making and preserving records of their past as a nation&rdquo; (Keegan, 2014). Due to the fact commoners were not able to record their thoughts in any purposeful manner, we are unable to compare the ideas left by Egyptians with anything but the official doctrine passed down through papyrus and other royal documents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Many Egyptian graffiti follow a similar pattern, consisting of chronological markers, usually accurate down to the day, respects for the royalty, and an explanation of the scribe&#39;s purpose in the region, that is, it seems the function of most Egyptian graffiti was &ldquo;to memorialize [an] experience for posterity&rdquo;. (Keegan, 2014). As opposed to most graffiti from later time periods, inscriptions from the time of the New Kingdom were almost always dated, often to the day (Peden, 2001). This dating of graffiti is significant, as it shows they wrote graffiti so they could assert their place in the continuous nature of the universe, by leaving their mark on seemingly permanent monuments, such as pyramids, temples, or cliffs. In this manner Egyptian graffiti reflects the meaning of life for them, living in accordance with the cyclic nature of reality.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By the time of the Greeks, literacy was much more common, at least in the cities. Many of the adult male citizens would be capable of literacy, and the great writing of the time was shared among all levels of society (Harris, 1991; Keegan 2014). As such, much of the graffiti remaining is that of both the commoners and the societal elite of the time, representing &ldquo;the meeting point between two &nbsp;genres of writing, between pragmatic, urban, everyday texts [of the commoners] and those that emerged from the sphere of elite cultural production&rsquo; and &lsquo;put the [poetic] canon to work in the ancient urban environment&rsquo;&rdquo; (Zadorojnyi, 2011). Even so, women, lower class men, and people living outside of the cities would probably not have been literate during this period. So while literacy was not limited to the most privileged, &ldquo;it is likely that only those who were exceptionally enterprising or fortunate became properly literate&rdquo; (Harris, 1991). This would be akin to our middle class, and that is reflected in the writing of the time. Interestingly, most of the graffiti surviving from this period would not be out of place in today&rsquo;s world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">What people choose to graffiti, what they value, has remained at its core consistent across long stretches of western history. Lomas (1973) notes, comparing graffiti collected from Los Angeles in 1965 and Pompeii circa AD 67 - 79, that the content of much latrinalia, graffiti in washrooms, hasn&rsquo;t changed much. The common themes identified by Lomas are political advertisement, sexual solicitation, the writer and his culture, sexual provocation, poetic humor, and derogatory attribute, or insults. These reflect what common people found as meaningful during these time periods, reproduction, assertions of masculinity, and a sense of belonging.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One problem with the study of graffiti is its ephemeral nature. Graffiti written outside is worn down by the elements, that written on wood structures are burnt to the ground, and that &nbsp;written inside was often painted or plastered over. Due to this, one of our greatest sources of surviving graffiti is English churches. Since some of these buildings have been around for 1400 years, with many still operating as churches, their interiors have been well maintained, and many contain a vast array of inscriptions from the past. As with literature, the official markings in the church often transmit the ideas and images of the &ldquo;parish elite&rdquo;, or as Champion (2015) says: &nbsp;&ldquo;The coloured glass of the medieval church window &hellip; rarely carry images of peasants ploughing --- they show instead the rich lords of the manor in all their finery&rdquo;. But surely it is not only the rich and powerful who have the desire for immortality, but how can the peasant class be remembered when &ldquo;the inside of &hellip; churches are monuments to those who afford to be memorialized&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With the uncertainty of the medieval world, it is easy to see why people would carve their name or important symbols into a church, since as opposed to inscriptions on paper, which also would have been hard for a commoner to come by, the &ldquo;act of inscribing them into a building that has stood for centuries may seem far more permanent and unshakable&rdquo; (Champion, 2015). Many churches would have been extremely old even during medieval times, and to the people of the day, the churches seemed eternal. They would have stood for as long as anyone could remember, and they would have no way of ever picturing them being destroyed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While &ldquo;many of the markings and graffiti found in English medieval churches [fell] into the categories of ritual protection marks, devotional graffiti or prayers&rdquo;, there were many other graffitos thats seem to have &ldquo;specific spiritual &lsquo;functions&rsquo; that fell well outside what we might consider the normal boundary of the orthodox church&rdquo; (Champion, 2015). These include magical protection spells and curses that fall outside of the official church doctrine. By seeing these symbols that are outside of the official church doctrine though, we see an alternate way of interpreting and reacting to the world and what the people of the time viewed as important, that is not church sanctioned, illustrating the sometimes divergent views between those in power and the populace. As noted by Keegan (2014), &ldquo;While the wielders of power almost always control the formulation of canonical truth in matters pertaining to the instigation and maintenance of political order, the ephemeral record on non-official markings capture expressions of practical action and private opinion by those belonging to the populations of the disenfranchised and dispossessed as much as the contented and self-interested&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While graffiti can be hard to date, unless it is explicitly dated, temporal concentrations of graffiti do occur when examining dated graffiti from across England. Champion (2015) finds &ldquo;[t]here are certain periods of time during which more graffiti was created. These periods include 1939-1945, 1914-1918, the early decades of the 19th century, and the middle of the seventeenth century -- All, of course, representing times of either national conflict or serious social unrest&rdquo;. Perhaps this explains why graffiti has become so prevalent in our times, for what could be a greater example of serious social unrest than a loss of collective meaning and connection between members of society? These writers are so starved for meaning today they engage in the &ldquo;illegal, dangerous and often obsessive activity of graffiti writing&rdquo; (Othen-Price, 2006) to the point where they adopt their graffiti identity as their own, living into it, and having it take over as their primary identity (MacDonald, 2001), in order to have a system they can generate meaning within.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Everyone feels the urge to lead a meaningful life, and if they are not in a position to achieve that in everyday society, they can turn to subcultures to find a system that allows them to generate meaning for themselves. People have a need to flourish which, according to Vervaeke and Ferraro (2013) consists of three dimensions, being: &ldquo;Subjective well-being&rdquo;, living a life that is considered &ldquo;morally respectable, both by the individual and by those whose moral judgement he or she respects&rdquo;, and having &ldquo;</span><span class="c10">meaning in life</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;, which they define as &ldquo; judg[ing] and experienc[ing] oneself as connected appropriately to something that has an important value independent from one&rsquo;s valuing it&rdquo;. In addition to these, the wise person is concerned with &ldquo;saying and doing relevant things&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The original modern graffiti writers were often disenfranchised youths from the inner city, who seemed to have no other outlet, no way of making their voices heard, and were systematically oppressed by society at large (Powers, 1996). When large enough groups of people feel excluded from society, it is not uncommon that &ldquo;[people] &ndash; particularly youth &ndash; join or form subcultures because they feel that dominant culture does not accept them&rdquo; (MacDiarmid &amp; Downing, 2012; Russell, 2008). Graffiti gave them a voice, and a tool that &ldquo;disrupts [the] orderly latticework of authority, reclaims public space for at least some of those systematically excluded from it, and thus resists the confinement of kids and others within structures of social and spatial control&rdquo; (Ferrell, 1995). These are people who definitely did not have &ldquo;subjective well-being&rdquo;, and so were forced to find other ways to &ldquo;flourish&rdquo; in life (Vervaeke &amp; Ferraro, 2013).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Graffiti has its own set of rules that writers live by, an unwritten graffiti code including not tagging on &ldquo;individuals, cars, or houses, but only large businesses, public buildings, and other urban symbols of the systems [they] oppose&rdquo; (Ferrell, 1995), and a well defined &ldquo;career path&rdquo; (MacDonald, 2001) for young writers. Many people unfamiliar with graffiti view it simply as mindless vandalism, or reasonless destruction, &ldquo;People cannot allow deviation to threaten their picture of what their society is about. Part of this picture involves recognising and accrediting certain motives as legitimate; if these motives cannot be found, then the behaviour cannot be tolerated, it must be neutralised or annihilated. Thus, vandalism, unlike theft, cannot be explained in terms of accredited motive of acquiring material gain, so it is described as motiveless. The only way of making sense of some actions is to assume that they do not make sense. Any other assumption would be threatening. We are very much concerned&hellip; with restoring meaning to behaviour which has been stripped of it in this way&rdquo; (Cohen, 1971). Graffiti norms exist, but are so isolated from the mainstream, it is almost impossible for people outside of the subculture to acknowledge them at all. Graffiti is not a world filled with &ldquo;chaos and anarchy&rdquo;, but one in which the participants are &ldquo;working hard to conform to their own meaningful guidelines and structures&rdquo; with &ldquo;the same dedication and diligence to achieve the same [success] as an individual does in any other profession&rdquo; (MacDonald, 2001). By sticking to the norms of the subculture, writers live a morally respectable life from the perspective of themselves and their peers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">People do graffiti to feel relevant, to integrate themselves into a culture that accepts them (Powers, 1996), that of the graffiti writer, to find their voice and create their own identity. &ldquo;Graffiti levels the playing field by getting past factors of privilege, such as social status, ethnicity, education, skill, and experience&rdquo; (Rodriguez, 2015). By leaving markings of themselves in the world, they escape one of human&rsquo;s greatest and oldest fears: That of being forgotten. This threat is made explicit in an ancient inscription from Pompeii, circa 79 ce: &ldquo;If someone writes something here, may he rot and his name be pronounced no more&rdquo;. The ultimate threat is that of being forgotten, your name, and therefore identity lost to time. A common thread in the study of graffiti is the idea that writing springs from the &ldquo;desire to leave a mark attesting to one&rsquo;s own existence and there-by achieve a &lsquo;certain pitiful immortality&rsquo;&rdquo; (Rodriguez, 2015).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Graffiti is a meritocracy, where writers are judged by their work alone, since due to it&rsquo;s anonymous nature, traditional rubrics that people are judged on are removed, such as race, social status, or wealth. When it comes to painting &ldquo;[t]he greater the danger, the greater the respect&rdquo; (Macdonald, 2001). By having clear markers of what it takes to achieve success in the world of graffiti, by achieving &ldquo;fame, respect and status [which] are not naturally evolving by-products of this subculture, [but] it&rsquo;s sole reason for being, and a writer&rsquo;s sole reason for being here&rdquo; (Macdonald, 2001), it makes easy for participants who participate in graffiti to be able to judge how successful they are, what their goals are, and be able to set out clear plans for achieving those ends, as opposed to their day-to-day life, where they can often be in less than ideal situations. The lack of ability to find meaning in the systems they were previously living in causes them to leave that identity, that system behind, and fully inhabit the world of graffiti writing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In an increasingly disconnected and chaotic world where many are finding it impossible to make much sense of what is happening, and prominent places we have historically turned to for wisdom or meaning are becoming obsolete, it is up to people to develop their own method of generating meaning. Some people turn to ideologies, others attempt to fervently apply science to places in life where it has no place, and still others create subcultures where they can have a clear idea of what they need to do to lead a meaningful life. Modern graffiti is one such system, by providing practitioners a clearly defined way to connect to others in the community, in a way that is meaningful to themselves, and to be relevant to the world outside.</span></p><p class="c0 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c6 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Champion, M.
